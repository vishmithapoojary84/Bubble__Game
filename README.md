ðŸŽ® Bubble Pop Game - Interactive Scoring Challenge
Project Overview: I developed a dynamic and engaging Bubble Pop Game that combines real-time interaction with a competitive scoring system. The game challenges users to pop bubbles displaying random numbers before time runs out, with the aim of achieving the highest score possible. This project showcases my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and responsive design.

Key Features:

Interactive Gameplay: Users click on bubbles that match a randomly selected target number. Each correct click increases the score by 10 points and refreshes the bubble display for continuous play.

Timer Mechanism: A countdown timer adds excitement and urgency to the game. The timer starts at 60 seconds and counts down to zero, signaling the end of the game and triggering the display of the final score.

Responsive Design: The game interface is optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Media queries adapt the layout and font sizes to different screen sizes, providing an enjoyable experience for all users.

Dynamic UI Updates: The game UI updates dynamically based on user interactions. Correct hits increase the score, while incorrect clicks are simply ignored, ensuring a smooth and engaging gameplay experience.
